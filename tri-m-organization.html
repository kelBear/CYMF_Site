            <p><em style="font-size:20px"><b>"</b></em>Unionville High School’s Tri-M Music Honor Society seeks to make a difference in senior homes all across Markham.
            They directly attempt to make the lives of seniors more enjoyable by showing and displaying that youth in Markham do care.
            Through their talent and passion for music, the Tri-M Music Society share and influence the seniors with entertainment.
            The Tri-M (Modern Music Masters) Music Honor Society is an international organization that is run by the National
            Association for Music Education (MENC). Dedicated music teachers and students who aim to share their passion for music
            with their communities, run tri-M chapters all across the globe.</p>

            <p>The Tri-M chapter at Unionville High School, under the leadership of President Chris Soong, performs at two
            senior homes in Unionville on the first two Fridays of every month of the year. The Tri-M group meets bi-weekly
            on Tuesday mornings to discuss upcoming performances and other endeavors. The Tri-M chapter at Unionville High School
            has recently been extending their niches and parameters to include children and students, with performances at
            daycares as well as local elementary music.</p>

            <p>Their passion for volunteering with Tri-M is rewarded with the enthusiasm and pleasure that seniors in Markham express.
            time Tri-M members perform at the Unionville Home Society and the Sunrise Living Centre of Unionville, they are greeted
            with the smiling faces of residents of these senior homes who anxiously await Tri-M’s monthly performances. Tri-M members
            interact with the residents and bridge the gap between the youth and the seniors in the community. They provide the often
            neglected seniors with warm company and enjoyable music. While the power of music to touch the soul is undeniable,
            Unionville High School’s Tri-M chapter illustrates this compelling power with every single performance.<em style="font-size:20px"><b>"</b></em></p>
