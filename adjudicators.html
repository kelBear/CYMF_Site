                        <p>Dennis Beck (BMus, BEd) began his musical teaching career in Edmonton, Alberta,
                        where he taught in both junior and senior high schools. Performing as a professional
                        clarinetist, most notably with the Edmonton Wind Sinfonia, he also taught and
                        conducted ensembles at the Alberta College Conservatory. During his twelve years in
                        Alberta, he obtained a graduate diploma in conducting from the University of Calgary.
                        Since returning to Ontario in 1990, he has taught at Unionville High School in York Region
                        for the Arts York Music Program. He is also a sessional lecturer for the Ontario Institute
                        for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. In addition, he has also been an
                        adjudicator at music festivals, speaks at band clinic sessions, and is a busy guest conductor.
                        In 2000, Dennis helped establish the Ontario Band Association. Dennis Beck has made many
                        important contributions to the education of music and has left lasting impressions to the musical
                        community. After his retirement in 2011, he is currently an avid photographer and traveler,
                        having visited almost 30 countries around the world. Dennis Beck is honored to be adjudicating
                        at the first annual Celebration Youth Music Festival, and hopes to inspire young musicians to
                        realize the power of music.</p>
